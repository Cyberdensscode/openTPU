# openTPU as an ASIC

The ASIC target of the multi-target work (`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-10-multi-target-design.md`,
D5 and D6): the same core RTL as the FPGA card, built from SRAM macros and standard cells, through
OpenROAD on NanGate45 for PPA numbers and as a rehearsal for a manufacturable PDK. How to run it:
`asic/nangate45/README.md`.

## The block

`rtl/asic/otpu_asic_top.sv`: one slice (`otpu_slice`) and its collective unit, with the slice's own
memory ports at the boundary (port A words, the SW byte writes, port B chunks, the ready / valid /
idle handshakes), the run control (resets, the loader, the run's arguments) and the status. The
DRAM side (PHY, controller, the channel interleave of `otpu_native_dram`) is the platform's, as
LiteDRAM is the YPCB card's; the block is what every openTPU chip shares.

## Memories

Every large memory of the core goes through a technology RAM (`rtl/tech/<family>/otpu_tech_ram.sv`:
`otpu_ram_1r1w`, `otpu_ram_1r1w_be`, `otpu_ram_1rw`; registered reads with an enable): IMEM, the ACT
RAM's pieces and scales, the DMA's chunk buffer, the MXU's chunk and scale FIFOs, the stream
engine's delay buffer, and the banked TMEM's banks. `rtl/tech/generic` infers them (Verilator,
yosys, the FPGA, with the `ram_style` they had); `rtl/tech/asic` tiles them onto macros of at most
128 bits x 4096 words (depth tiles with a registered read select). Small asynchronous-read RAMs
(the dispatch window, the MXU's drain rows, the VPU's row sums, the quantizer's block buffer) stay
flip-flops.

**TMEM.** The FPGA keeps a copy of TMEM per read port (block RAM is cheap there; reads never
conflict). The ASIC's TMEM is banked (`otpu_tmem` IMPL 1, `otpu_slice` TMEM_IMPL 1): three copies of
LANES 1R1W bank RAMs, each bank one read and one write per cycle (RPB 1, WPB 1), writes to every
copy. A read port sits on one copy (`CPY`): copy 0 MXU, QUANT, VPU A; copy 1 VPU B, QUANT 2; copy 2
DMA, QUANT 3, COLL. The ports of one arbitration group are on different copies, so a group alone
always fits (the quantizer reads three ports at once, the VPU two; with fewer copies they could
never be granted). The slice's arbiter counts per copy and bank (`gnt_k`), and a bank's address
comes from the port granted in it. Results are the same as the FPGA's (the ISA simulator's); cycles
differ where ports meet in a bank. Three copies is 3x the TMEM's bits (the FPGA build has six); a
two-copy TMEM needs the quantizer's row-factor read off the TMEM ports.

**Macros.** NanGate45 has no memory compiler. `tools/asic/fakeram.py` writes abstract macros in
bsg_fakeram's form (the pins, layers and straps of ORFS's fakeram45 macros) for 1RW and 1R1W
(bsg_fakeram makes 1RW only), any size, with area, clock-to-q, minimum period and clock power fitted
to ORFS's 24 fakeram45 macros (CACTI); a 1R1W macro is 1.5x the 1RW's area. IHP SG13G2 and
commercial nodes have 2-port (1R1W) macros; GF180 has 1RW only, so a 1RW TMEM is a later variant.
